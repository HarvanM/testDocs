        HMAC-SHA256 authentication. The request must include:
        
        - `Authorization` header: `HMAC-SHA256 <access_key>:<signature>`
        
        - `X-Timestamp` header: Unix timestamp (seconds).
        
        
        The HMAC signature is computed as:
        
        
        ```
        HMAC_SHA256(secret_key, url + "\n" + timestamp + "\n" + body)

        - `secret_key`: You can generate secret_key in mobile app.
        
        - `url`: Full request URL (excluding query parameters).
        
        - `timestamp`: Value from `X-Timestamp` header.
        
        - `body`: Request payload (empty for `GET` requests).
        
        
        The server will reject requests with timestamps too far from the current time.

        The current Unix timestamp in seconds. Used to prevent replay attacks. 
        Requests with timestamps older than a configured threshold (e.g., 5 minutes) 
        will be rejected.
